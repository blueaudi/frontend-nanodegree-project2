Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Project 2 (Resume)
This project was prepared as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
It includes files necessary to construct a webpage that displays the resume of Glenn Hepler.
The following major files are included:
  (1) index.html,
  (2) /css/style.css,
  (3) /css/custom.css,
  (4) /js/resumebuilder.js, and
  (5) /js/helper.js.
The final constructed webpage includes expandable sections for Work Experience, Education, and Projects.
It also includes an interactive Google map that displays an image and pertinent information about locations
 where I have lived and worked when the appropriate location marker is clicked.
The webpage is responsive - styles and other display characteristics change as the width of the display is
 altered.
